# springboard
A Platform for Launching a Board Game

### Wanna try it out?
```
git clone git@github.com:sethtoles/springboard.git
cd springboard
npm install
```
Then open `springboard/client/index.html` in any browser with modern JavaScript functionality (only tested in Chrome with chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony enabled).

## Features
#### Board
You get a grid of fixed size. Enjoy it. You can drag it around the window with the handle on the right.

#### Game Pieces
Click anywhere to create a game piece. Click and drag a piece to move it. By default the piece will snap to a grid, but holding <kbd>alt</kbd> allows you to move the piece freely. Right-click on a piece removes it.
